Toolbox to compute **Cri**ticality **Me**asures 
(e.g. time-to-collision, time-to-react,...). Such measures
can be used to trigger warnings and emergency maneuvers 
in driver assistance systems or repair an infeasible 
trajectory. If you have questions or want to report problems or suggestions, please start a [Github discussion](https://github.com/orgs/CommonRoad/discussions) /

## ðŸš€ Installation Guide

`commonroad-crime` can be installed with:

``` bash
$ pip install commonroad-crime
```
<details>
<summary><b>Develop CriMe locally</b></summary>

For adding new measures, we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage your environment so that even if you mess something up, you can always have a safe and clean restart. A guide for managing python environments with Anaconda can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

After installing Anaconda, create a new environment with:
``` bash
$ conda create -n commonroad-py38 python=3.8 -y
```

Here the name of the environment is called **commonroad-py38**. You may also change this name as you wish. In such case, don't forget to change it in the following commands as well. **Always activate** this environment before you do anything related:

```sh
$ conda activate commonroad-py38
or
$ source activate commonroad-py38
```
Then, install the dependencies with:

```sh
$ cd <path-to-this-repo>
$ pip install -e .
$ conda develop .
```

To test the installition, run unittest:
```bash
$ cd tests
$ python -m unittest -v
```

To get started your journey with our criticality measures, check the `tutorials` and the following tips.

<details>
<summary><b>Add new criticality measure</b></summary>

1. create a new branch with `feature-<measure-name>` and checkout the branch
2. navigate to `commonroad_crime/data_structure/type.py` to find the correct category of the measure and add an 
enumeration entry `<abbreviation>: <explanation>`
3. navigate to `commonroad_crime/measure` to find the above-mentioned category and create a python file named
`<abbreviation>.py`. Then create a class inheriting the `CriMeBase` under `commonroad_crime/data_structure/base.py`
4. similar to other measures, you need to implement the `compute()` and `visualize()` functions

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Define configuration parameters of the measure</b></summary>

1. navigate to `commonroad_crime/data_structure/configuation.py` to find the above-mentioned category and add a new 
instance to the class as `self.<parameter> = config_relevant.<parameter>`
2. you can then directly call the values using `self.configuration.<category>.<parameter>` in your measure class
3. to override the default parameter values, create a `yaml` file (name it the same as the scenario) in `./config_files` and modify the values there
